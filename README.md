# SCT_ML_3 - Cat vs Dog Image Classification

This repository contains Task 3 of the SkillCraft Machine Learning Internship. The task focuses on building a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model to classify images of cats and dogs.

## Objective

Train a CNN model to accurately classify images into two categories: **Cat** and **Dog**.

## Technologies Used

- Python
- TensorFlow / Keras
- NumPy
- Matplotlib

## Folder Structure

- `Cat/` – Folder containing cat images
- `Dog/` – Folder containing dog images
- `task3.py` – Python script for training the image classification model

## Key Concepts

- Convolutional Neural Networks
- Image preprocessing and augmentation
- Model evaluation and accuracy tracking
